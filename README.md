# Transition from tools.ietf.org

As announced March 2021, tools.ietf.org is being wound down. [See the announcement here.](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ietf/0n-6EXEmkTp3Uv_vj-5Vnm3o0bo/)

This page is tracking the current plan to finalize the transition, and will provide help for others migrating to the new locations of various services.

Work is currently underway to replace the BibXML services from xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org, and the online document validation/conversion services.

Anything not discussed on this page is not currently planned to transition. As noted in the announcement, if you are using something at tools.ietf.org and haven't found a replacement for it, let the tools team know. The best way now is to open an issue on this repository. A message to tools-discuss will also work.

## New service locations

As replacement services have been put in place, tools.ietf.org has been configured to redirect to them. After it is wound down, a redirect service will remain in place.
